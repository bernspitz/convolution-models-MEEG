# Workshop/tutorial code: Convolution models for M/EEG, Bernhard Spitzer (2015)
Matlab code for convolution workshop as presented e.g., at Cutting EEG (II) Symposium 2015, Berlin. The code is designed to run with SPM12 (r6470; please check compatibility with newer revisions; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/); a 64-bit operating system and large RAM (min 8GB) are strongly recommended. The tutorial data (>100MB) is available upon request. If you have any questions, or spot any errors, please contact bernhard.spitzer (at) psy.ox.ac.uk
