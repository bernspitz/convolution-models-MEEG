# Workshop materials: Convolution models for M/EEG, Bernhard Spitzer (2015)
Matlab scripts for convolution workshop presented e.g., at Cutting EEG (II) Symposium 2015, Berlin. The code is designed to run with SPM12 (r6470; please check compatibility with newer revisions; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/); a 64-bit operating system and large RAM (min. 8GB) are strongly recommended. Tutorial data >100MB is available upon request. If you have any questions, or spot any errors, please contact bernhard.spitzer (at) psy.ox.ac.uk
